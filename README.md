# ML-Mini-Projects
A collection of machine learning mini-projects exploring fundamental techniques including curve fitting, gradient descent, data augmentation, noise robustness, PCA, and chaotic system simulation.


Using ML in Physics
- Modeled a chaotic physical system (double pendulum) using Python numerical methods.  
- Visualized system dynamics and highlighted sensitivity to initial conditions.  

Curve Fitting with Gradient Descent
- Implemented polynomial regression from scratch using NumPy
- Developed stochastic gradient descent to minimize mean squared error.
- Compared underfitting/overfitting using 1st, 3rd, and 7th order polynomial models.

MNIST Noise Robustness
- Built a neural network  to classify MNIST digits with >95% accuracy.  
- Investigated model robustness to noise by adding varying levels of random pixel noise.  
- Retrained with noisy data to evaluate the effect of data augmentation and regularisation.  

MNIST with PCA
- Applied Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction of MNIST images
- Tested neural network performance with reduced feature sets.  
- Explored tradeoffs between number of PCA components and test accuracy.
